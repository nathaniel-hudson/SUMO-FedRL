# SUMO-FedRL
Implementation of Federated Reinforcement Learning for traffic control using SUMO and a 
real-world testbed.

The goal of this project is to provide a platform for *simple* single- and multi-agent
reinforcement learning (RL) and federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) for smart traffic
light control. The traffic simulator we use is SUMO.
